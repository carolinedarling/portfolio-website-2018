Description: README for CS290 Project
Date: 11/06/2017


Hello! I loved making this portfolio site. It's the first polished website I made on
my own that wasn't a code-along.


Note: All links to github simply link to my github account instead of individual projects,
because the projects themselves are not actually on my github / don't exist yet.
I will update them later as I create them.
